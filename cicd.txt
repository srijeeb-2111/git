“To create a CI/CD pipeline, I’d start by connecting the application’s GitHub repository to Jenkins using webhooks. Whenever code is pushed, Jenkins would pull the repo, build the application into a Docker image, and run automated tests. If tests pass, Jenkins would push the Docker image to Docker Hub, and then trigger a deployment step using Kubernetes (or Ansible for VMs). This ensures that every code change is tested, packaged, and deployed automatically with minimal manual effort.”
